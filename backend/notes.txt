INITIALIZATION
-------------------
1. npm init
  - automatically generates a package.json file.
2. add "start": "node index.js" to the package.json file.
  - can run the the program with either node index.js or npm start
  - customary for npm projects to execute with such scripts.
3. npm install express
  - Could implement backend server but becomes a problem as project grows.
  - express is the most popular library to build a backend server.
  - Source code is placed in the node_modules directory at root of project
4. npm install --save-dev nodemon
  - This package will automatically restart application when files change.
5. Add "dev": "nodemon index.js" to package.json under scripts.
  - Have to start it with node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js otherwise
  - Can now start by running command npm run dev
